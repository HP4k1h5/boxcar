=============================

Given (boxes a and b):
  ```
        ┏━┓
        ┃a┃
        ┗━┛
      ┏━━━━━━━━━┓
      ┃ b       ┃
      ┃         ┃
      ┗━━━━━━━━━┛
  
  ```

Execute (put cursor in box a and inc by 3 5):
  call cursor(5,16)
  call boxcar#box#resize(1, 9, 0)
  " check that cursor has not moved
  AssertEqual getpos('.'), [0,5,16,0]

Expect (an even bigger box in the right place):
  ```
  
      ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
      ┃ abc              ┃
      ┃      xyw         ┃
      ┃                  ┃
      ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
  
  ```
